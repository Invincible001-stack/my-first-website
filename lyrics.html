           <h2>
            Well there's a river that runs through Glasgow
            And makes her but it breaks her and takes her into the parks
            And her current just like my blood flows
            Down from the hills, round aching bones to my restless heart

            Well I would swim but the river is so wide
            And I'm scared I won't make it to the other side
            Well God knows I've failed but He knows that I've tried
            I long for something that's safe and warm
            But all I have is all that is gone
            I'm as helpless and as hopeless as a feather on the Clyde

            Well on one side all the lights glow
            And the folks know and the kids go where the music and the drinking starts
            On the other side where no cars go
            Up to the hills that stand alone like my restless heart

            Well I would swim but the river is so wide
            And I'm scared I won't make it to the other side
            Well God knows I've failed but He knows that I've tried
            I long for something that's safe and warm
            But all I have is all that is gone
            I'm as helpless and as hopeless as a feather on the Clyde

            Well the sun sets late in Glasgow
            And the daylight and the city part
            And I think of you in Glasgow
            'Cause you're all that's safe, you're all that's warm in my restless heart
